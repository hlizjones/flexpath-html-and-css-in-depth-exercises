                vs
Web applications: sites w/ js, very interactive


API wraps complex functionalities and streamlines use in a simple to use way
    Using JS objects to interact with APIs and use their functionality w/o writting their code

Examples: 
    Geolocation (tracking user through broswer)
    Storage 
        Cookies:
            limited in size (4 kB)
            sent back and forth btw browser and server w/ every request -> affects performance if they grow large
            expiration date
        WebStorage:
            not sent to server each time
            larger amounts of data
            no expiration date -> exists until the user deletes data
            Local Storage: stores info in user's browser we can access later to remember login/preferences

    Audio and video(change playbackspeed, etc)
    Drag and drop(dragging content to other area of page)
